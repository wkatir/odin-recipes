    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Victoria sponge cake (a.k.a. a Victoria sandwich) is a British dessert that consists of jam and cream sandwiched between two delicate cake layers. 
        The dish gets its name from Queen Victoria, who is said 
        to have made a habit of enjoying the cake with her afternoon tea. </p>
    <h2>Victoria Sponge Cake Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the cake: </strong>baking spray, all-purpose flour, baking powder, cornstarch, kosher salt, granulated sugar, butter or margarine, eggs, vanilla extract, whole milk, and strawberry or raspberry preserves</li>
        <li> <strong>For the whipped cream: </strong>heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract</li>
        <li><strong>To garnish: </strong>Powdered sugar and fresh strawberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>baking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour (such as Gold Medal)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter or margarine, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup strawberry or raspberry preserves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with baking spray; line bottoms with parchment paper. Lightly spray parchment paper with baking spray.</li>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>Sift flour, cornstarch, and baking powder into a medium bowl; whisk in salt and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. (The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color.)</li>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>Beat in eggs, one at a time, on medium speed, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next, 1 to 2 minutes total. Beat in 2 teaspoons vanilla. With mixer on medium-low speed, add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk, beating until just combined after each addition.</li>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 18 to 22 minutes. Cool cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto a wire rack. Let stand, parchment side down, on wire racks until cooled completely, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>Remove and discard parchment paper. Place 1 cake layer on a serving plate. Stir preserves in a small bowl until mostly smooth; spread in an even layer over cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>To make vanilla whipped cream: Whisk heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract by hand in a large bowl until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Dollop over jam, then spread into an even layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>Top with remaining cake layer. Dust with powdered sugar and garnish with strawberries (if using).</li>
    </ol>
